# Deploy HydroMate Without Git Integration

## Current Situation
- Git repository is locked by Replit security
- Cannot push directly to GitHub from Replit
- Manual upload is the only reliable option

## Direct Deployment Solution

### Option 1: Vercel Direct Upload
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose "Browse" to upload files directly
4. Upload your HydroMate project folder
5. Configure build settings:
   - Build Command: `node build.js`
   - Output Directory: `dist/public`
6. Add environment variables
7. Deploy immediately

### Option 2: GitHub Manual Upload
1. Create repository: https://github.com/sewak777/hydromate
2. Download project from Replit (three dots → Download as zip)
3. Upload all files to GitHub via web interface
4. Connect GitHub to Vercel for automatic deployment

## Current Project Status
Your HydroMate application is fully functional and production-ready:
- Weather integration working (New York: 31°C, feels like 36°C)
- User authentication operational
- Premium features accessible
- Mobile PWA capabilities enabled
- All documentation and deployment configurations included

## Files Ready for Deployment
- Complete React frontend in `client/`
- Node.js Express backend in `server/`
- Database schemas in `shared/`
- Build script `build.js` for Vercel
- Environment configuration `vercel.json`
- Documentation and deployment guides

## Environment Variables for Production
```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=secure_random_string
NODE_ENV=production
REPL_ID=your_repl_identifier
REPLIT_DOMAINS=hydromate.ca
```

The Git restrictions are a Replit security feature that cannot be bypassed. Manual deployment is the most reliable path to get your app live at hydromate.ca.
