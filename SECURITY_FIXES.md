# CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES IMPLEMENTED

## Phase 1: Authentication & Authorization Hardening

### 1. Production Authentication Enforcement
- Fixed feature flags to require authentication in production
- Removed authentication bypass in production environment
- Added strict environment-based security controls

### 2. User Isolation & Data Protection
