# Replit GitHub Integration Guide

## How to Connect Your HydroMate Project to GitHub

### Step 1: Open Version Control in Replit
1. Look for the **Git** icon in your Replit sidebar (looks like a branching symbol)
2. Click on it to open the version control panel

### Step 2: Connect to GitHub
1. In the Git panel, click **"Connect to GitHub"**
2. You'll be prompted to authorize Replit to access your GitHub account
3. Click **"Authorize Replit"** when prompted

### Step 3: Link to Your Repository
1. After authorization, you'll see options to:
   - Create a new repository, OR
   - Connect to existing repository
2. Choose **"Connect to existing repository"**
3. Select your repository: `sewak777/Hobby-repo`

### Step 4: Configure Repository Settings
1. Set the repository path to root (/) or create a subdirectory
2. Choose to push your current code
3. Replit will automatically sync your HydroMate project

### Step 5: Push Your Code
1. In the Git panel, you'll see all your files ready to commit
2. Add a commit message: "feat: add HydroMate hydration tracking application"
3. Click **"Commit and Push"**

## Alternative: Using Replit's GitHub Import
If the above doesn't work:
1. Go to your Replit dashboard
2. Click **"Create Repl"**
3. Choose **"Import from GitHub"**
4. Enter: `https://github.com/sewak777/Hobby-repo.git`
5. This will create a new Repl connected to your GitHub repo

## What Happens After Integration
- Your HydroMate code will be in your GitHub repository
- Any changes you make in Replit will sync to GitHub
- You can deploy directly from GitHub to Vercel/Netlify

## Current Project Status
Your HydroMate application is production-ready with:
- Complete hydration tracking system
- Weather integration (New York: 27Â°C, +100ml recommendation)
- User authentication and premium features

Once connected to GitHub, you can immediately deploy to production at hydromate.ca!
