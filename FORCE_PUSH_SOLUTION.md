# Force Push Solution - Overwrite Remote Repository

## The Issue
Remote repository contains work (likely README.md or initial files) that conflicts with your local project.

## Solution: Force Push
Since you want to deploy your complete HydroMate application, force push to overwrite the remote:

### In Shell, run:
```bash
git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/sewak777/hydromate.git main --force
```

## Alternative: Delete and Recreate Repository
If force push doesn't work:

1. **Delete current repository:**
   - Go to https://github.com/sewak777/hydromate
   - Settings → Danger Zone → Delete Repository

2. **Create fresh repository:**
   - New repository → "hydromate"
   - Make it public
   - Don't initialize with files

3. **Push to clean repository:**
   ```bash
   git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/sewak777/hydromate.git main
   ```

## Current Project Status
Your HydroMate application is complete and ready:
- Weather integration working (32°C New York)
- Authentication functional
- All features operational
- Production configurations ready

Once pushed to GitHub, immediate deployment to Vercel and domain connection to hydromate.ca.
