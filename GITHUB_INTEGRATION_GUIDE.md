# GitHub Integration Guide - Fix 403 Error

## 403 Error Solutions

### Option 1: Check Token Permissions
Your personal access token needs these permissions:
- `repo` (full repository access)
- `workflow` (if using GitHub Actions)

### Option 2: Correct Repository URL
The current remote shows `Hydromate` (capital H), but you created `hydromate` (lowercase). 

**Fix the URL in Shell:**
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/sewak777/hydromate.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: Create Repository First
1. Go to https://github.com/sewak777
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name: **hydromate** (lowercase)
4. Make it public
5. Don't initialize with files
6. Click "Create repository"

Then push:
```bash
git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/sewak777/hydromate.git main
```

### Option 4: Alternative - Direct Upload
If Git continues failing:
1. Download project: Three dots → "Download as zip"
2. Go to GitHub repository
3. Click "uploading an existing file"
4. Drag all files from extracted zip
5. Commit changes

## Current Status
Your HydroMate app is working perfectly:
- Weather: 32°C New York, feels like 37°C
- Authentication operational
- Ready for deployment

The 403 error is likely due to repository name mismatch (Hydromate vs hydromate) or token permissions.
