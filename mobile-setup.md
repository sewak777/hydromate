# HydroFlow Mobile Development Setup

## Overview
Your HydroFlow web application is now ready for native mobile development using Capacitor. This setup allows you to:
- Create native iOS and Android apps
- Access device features (camera, geolocation, notifications)
- Maintain a single codebase across web and mobile

## Prerequisites

### For Android Development:
- **Android Studio** (latest version)
- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+**
- **Android SDK** (API level 22+)
- **Gradle** (included with Android Studio)

### For iOS Development:
- **Xcode 14+** (macOS only)
- **iOS Simulator** (included with Xcode)
- **Apple Developer Account** (for device testing and App Store)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Initialize Capacitor Project
```bash
npm run mobile:init
```

### 2. Add Platform Support

**For Android:**
```bash
npm run mobile:add:android
```

**For iOS:**
```bash
npm run mobile:add:ios
```

### 3. Build and Sync
```bash
npm run mobile:build
npm run mobile:sync
```

### 4. Open in Native IDEs

**Android Studio:**
```bash
npm run mobile:open:android
```

**Xcode:**
```bash
npm run mobile:open:ios
```

## Native Features Implemented

### ✅ Device Integration
- **Haptic Feedback** - Touch feedback for button interactions
- **Status Bar** - Customized with app colors
- **Splash Screen** - Branded loading screen
- **Network Detection** - Online/offline status monitoring

### ✅ Notifications
- **Local Notifications** - Water reminder alerts
- **Push Notifications** - Ready for server integration
- **Scheduling** - Timed hydration reminders

### ✅ Device APIs
- **Geolocation** - Weather-based hydration recommendations
- **Storage** - Offline data persistence
- **App State** - Background/foreground detection
- **Back Button** - Android navigation handling

### ✅ Platform Detection
- Automatic platform-specific behavior
- Progressive enhancement for native features
- Graceful fallbacks for web platform

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development:
1. Make changes to your React code
2. Test in browser: `npm run dev`
3. Build for mobile: `npm run mobile:build`
4. Test on device: `npm run mobile:run:android` or `npm run mobile:run:ios`

### Build Process:
1. Web build: `npm run build`
2. Copy to native: `npx cap copy`
3. Sync plugins: `npx cap sync`
4. Open in IDE for final build and testing

## App Store Preparation

### Android (Google Play Store):
- Generate signing key
- Configure app bundle settings
- Add required permissions in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- Create store assets (screenshots, descriptions)

### iOS (Apple App Store):
- Configure bundle identifier
- Set up provisioning profiles
- Add required capabilities in Xcode
- Create store assets and metadata

## Environment Variables for Mobile

The following environment variables work across web and mobile:
- Database connections (already configured)
- API keys (weather, analytics)
- Feature flags (cross-platform)

## Native-Specific Configuration

### Android Permissions:
- Location access for weather features
- Notification permissions for reminders
- Network state for offline detection

### iOS Capabilities:
- Background app refresh for reminder notifications
- Location services for weather integration
- Push notifications for engagement

## Testing Strategy

1. **Web Testing** - Browser development and testing
2. **PWA Testing** - Install as web app on mobile
3. **Native Testing** - Device/simulator testing
4. **Cross-Platform** - Feature parity verification

Your HydroFlow app is now ready for native mobile development with all core features adapted for mobile platforms!
