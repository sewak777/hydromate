2. Select "Download as zip"
3. Extract the zip file on your computer

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub

2. If repository doesn't exist, create it:
   - Click "New repository"
   - Name: **hydromate**
   - Make it public
   - Click "Create repository"

3. Upload files:
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag ALL extracted files from the zip
   - Add commit message: "feat: add HydroMate hydration tracking application"
   - Click "Commit changes"

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel
