# Hobby-Repo Conflict Resolution

## Potential Issue
If your Replit project was previously connected to a "hobby-repo" or different repository, there might be conflicting Git configurations causing authentication issues.

## Solution: Clean Git Configuration

### In Shell, run these commands:

1. **Remove all remotes:**
```bash
git remote remove origin
```

2. **Add correct remote:**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/sewak777/hydromate.git
```

3. **Set up authentication with token:**
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/sewak777/hydromate.git
```

4. **Force push:**
```bash
git push -u origin main --force
```

## Alternative: Fresh Start
If conflicts persist:

1. **Backup current work:**
   - Download as zip from Replit

2. **Reinitialize Git:**
```bash
rm -rf .git
git init
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add HydroMate hydration tracking application"
git remote add origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/sewak777/hydromate.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Current Status
Your HydroMate app is working perfectly:
- Weather: 32°C New York, clear sky, feels like 37°C
- Authentication functional
- Ready for deployment

The hobby-repo connection could indeed be causing the authentication conflicts.
